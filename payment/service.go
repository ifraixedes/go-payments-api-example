// documented on them, the following error codes:
//
// * ErrUnexpectedStoreError

	// c. Each payment only contains the fields indicated by s.
	// If there is not payments which fulfill f or the chunk specified by p is out
	// of range, an empty list and nil error are returned.

	// The following error codes can be returned:
	//
	// * ErrInvalidArgVersionMismatch - When the version doesn't match with the
	// current payment version for avoiding to override the payment concurrently.
	//
	// * ErrNotFound
